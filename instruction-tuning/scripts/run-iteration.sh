You are running instruction tuning iteration $ITER.
Read .claude/tuning-handoff.md if it exists for prior context.
Read .claude/skills/instruction-tuning/SKILL.md for the process.

Launch discovery agents per the skill's Parallel Testing section.
Use target sites from .claude/tuning-handoff.md (or choose appropriate test targets).
Assign ports starting at 3011, one per agent.

Wait for ALL agents to complete.
Score each against the scorecard in the SKILL.md.
Write results to .claude/tuning-handoff.md.
Do NOT fix instructions — just report results.

# 3. Clean between phases

claude -p "
Read .claude/tuning-handoff.md for iteration $ITER results.
Analyze what agents got wrong. Look at:
- Did they fill all 8 elimination rows?
- Did they build routes for every transport found?
- Where did they waste tool calls?
- What patterns are missing from test-server/boardshop?

Fix the instructions in .claude/rules/ and .claude/agents/.
Add any new patterns to test-server and boardshop.
Commit all changes. Push to origin.
Update .claude/tuning-handoff.md for iteration $((ITER + 1)).
